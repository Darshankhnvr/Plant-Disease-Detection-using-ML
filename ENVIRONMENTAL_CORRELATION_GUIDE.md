# Environmental Correlation System - How It Works

## Overview
The environmental correlation system enhances disease prediction accuracy by analyzing how environmental conditions (pH, temperature, humidity) correlate with specific plant diseases. This provides more reliable diagnoses and actionable insights for farmers.

## How the Algorithm Works

### 1. Disease-Environment Database
The system contains research-based data for each disease, including:
- **Optimal Conditions**: Environmental ranges where the disease thrives
- **High-Risk Conditions**: Specific ranges with maximum disease likelihood  
- **Environmental Weight**: How much environment affects this particular disease (0.7-0.95)

### 2. Risk Score Calculation
For each environmental factor (temperature, humidity, pH):
- **High Risk Range**: Score 0.8-0.9 (conditions perfect for disease)
- **Optimal Range**: Score 0.5-0.7 (conditions support disease)
- **Unfavorable Range**: Score 0.2-0.3 (conditions don't support disease)

### 3. Confidence Adjustment
```python
confidence_adjustment = (avg_risk_score - 0.5) * environmental_weight * 20
```
- **Positive adjustment**: Environmental conditions support the diagnosis
- **Negative adjustment**: Environmental conditions contradict the diagnosis
- **Maximum adjustment**: ±20% based on environmental correlation strength

### 4. Risk Assessment
- **High Risk** (0.7+): Environmental conditions strongly favor disease development
- **Moderate Risk** (0.5-0.7): Conditions somewhat support disease
- **Low Risk** (<0.5): Conditions don't favor disease development

## Example: Tomato Late Blight

### High-Risk Scenario
- **Temperature**: 20°C (perfect for late blight)
- **Humidity**: 95% (very high - ideal for disease)
- **Soil pH**: 6.2 (optimal range)
- **Result**: Confidence increases from 75% → 80.7%

### Low-Risk Scenario  
- **Temperature**: 30°C (too hot for late blight)
- **Humidity**: 50% (too dry for disease)
- **Soil pH**: 7.5 (not optimal)
- **Result**: Confidence decreases from 75% → 69.9%

## Supported Diseases
The system has environmental correlation data for:
- Apple Scab, Black Rot, Cedar Apple Rust
- Tomato Early Blight, Late Blight, Septoria Leaf Spot
- Potato Early Blight, Late Blight
- Corn Common Rust
- Grape Black Rot, Esca
- Cherry Powdery Mildew

## Benefits

### 1. Improved Accuracy
- Reduces false positives when environmental conditions don't support the disease
- Increases confidence when conditions are perfect for disease development

### 2. Actionable Insights
- Provides specific environmental risk factors
- Offers recommendations for optimal growing conditions
- Helps farmers understand why diseases occur

### 3. Preventive Guidance
- Identifies high-risk environmental conditions before disease appears
- Suggests environmental modifications to reduce disease likelihood
- Supports integrated pest management strategies

## Technical Implementation
